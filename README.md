        <h1>Mohamad Abou-Hechme</h1>
        <p><strong>Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Future SOC Analyst</strong></p>
        <p>From a young age, I was always fascinated by **networking, systems, and cybersecurity**â€”tinkering with software, hardware, and operating systems as a teenager. This passion has stayed with me over the years and is now driving my transition into cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>Although I studied **Banking and Finance**, my career began in administration. However, my true interest has always been in **technology and security**.</p>
        <p>I'm currently focusing on **SOC (Security Operations Center) analysis**, cloud security, and hands-on cybersecurity labs to build real-world skills. My goal is to become a **SOC Analyst Tier 1**, helping defend networks and respond to cyber threats.</p>
